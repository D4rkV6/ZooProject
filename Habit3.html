<h1>Alligators</h1>
<p>Alligators are large reptiles and members of the order Crocodylia</p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<ul>
    <li>An alligator is distinguished by its wide, rounded snout and black color. When an alligator rests with its jaws closed, only its upper teeth are visible. Crocodiles, on the other hand, have narrow, pointed snouts, a grey-green color and both upper and lower teeth visible when the animal's mouth is closed</li>
    <li>Crocodiles and alligators rarely overlap in range, so another way to tell them apart is to know where you are. American alligators, which live across the southern U.S., only overlap with American crocodiles at the southern tip of Florida, according to National Geographic. Chinese alligators are the only crocodilian anywhere near their range.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Where Alligators found/live</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The American alligator lives in the southern United States from eastern Texas and Oklahoma to North Carolina, and are well known throughout Florida, according to the Smithsonian Zoo. These gators can be found in slow-moving rivers, ponds, lakes and swamps.</li>
    <li>Chinese alligators live in eastern China, and are confined to a small area in the Yangtze River basin near the Pacific Ocean, according to the Saint Louis Zoo. They are traditionally found in rivers, lakes, ponds and swamps, but are now confined mostly to ditches and ponds on agricultural land. Much of their habitat has been converted to rice paddies.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How much a alligator can weigh</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The American alligator can grow up to 11.2 feet (3.4 meters) long and weigh nearly half a ton (1,000 lbs. or 454 kilograms), according to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park. Chinese alligators are smaller, growing to around 4.6 to 4.9 feet (1.4 to 1.5 m) long and usually weighing only around 50 lbs. (22.7 kg).</li>
